# restaurant-journal
A social media web application that allows users to select restaurants using Google Maps API and create a journal entry describing their visit, detailing what they ordered and what they thought about it. Users will be able to create an account and add other users to see what restaurants they've been to and enjoyed (or didn't enjoy).
